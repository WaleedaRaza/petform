# Clerk Flutter Integration Plan

## The Problem
Clerk's REST API is designed for server-side operations, not client-side authentication. The 404 and 400 errors we're getting are because we're trying to use server-side endpoints from the client.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Clerk's Web SDK with WebView (Recommended)
1. **Install webview_flutter**
2. **Create a WebView wrapper** for Clerk's authentication UI
3. **Use Clerk's hosted authentication pages**
4. **Handle authentication via JavaScript bridge**

### Option 2: Create Custom Authentication UI
1. **Build custom Flutter UI** for signup/signin
2. **Use Clerk's REST API** for server-side operations only
3. **Implement JWT token handling**
4. **Store tokens securely**

### Option 3: Use Clerk's Mobile SDK (If Available)
1. **Check if Clerk has a Flutter SDK**
2. **Use official mobile SDK** if available
3. **Follow official documentation**

## Recommended Approach: Option 1 (WebView)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  webview_flutter: ^4.0.0
  flutter_web_auth: ^0.5.0
```

### Step 2: Create WebView Authentication
```dart
// Use Clerk's hosted authentication pages
// Handle authentication via JavaScript bridge
// Store tokens securely in Flutter
```

### Step 3: Update Clerk Service
```dart
// Use WebView for authentication
// Handle tokens and user data
// Integrate with existing app flow
```

## Alternative: Keep Supabase Auth for Now

Since Clerk integration is complex without a proper Flutter SDK, we could:

1. **Keep using Supabase Auth** for now
2. **Focus on other app features**
3. **Plan Clerk migration for later**
4. **Use Clerk's web dashboard** for user management

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on approach** (WebView vs Custom UI vs Keep Supabase)
2. **Implement chosen solution**
3. **Test authentication flow**
4. **Integrate with existing app**

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ API keys obtained
- ‚ùå REST API doesn't work for client-side auth
