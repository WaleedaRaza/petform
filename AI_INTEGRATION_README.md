## Usage Examples

### Health Query
**User**: "How much exercise does my dog need?"
**Context**: 2-year-old Golden Retriever, currently tracking 30 minutes daily
**AI Response**: 
```
üè• Health Advice for Max:

Based on Max's breed (Golden Retriever) and age (2 years), he needs 1-2 hours of exercise daily. Since you're currently tracking 30 minutes, here's how to increase his activity:

‚Ä¢ Morning walk: 30-45 minutes
‚Ä¢ Afternoon play session: 20-30 minutes  
‚Ä¢ Evening walk: 30-45 minutes
‚Ä¢ Weekend activities: Hiking, swimming, or fetch

Golden Retrievers are high-energy dogs that thrive on physical and mental stimulation. Consider adding:
- Puzzle toys for mental exercise
- Training sessions for obedience
- Socialization with other dogs

Monitor his energy levels and adjust accordingly. If he seems restless or destructive, he may need more exercise.
```

### Behavior Query
**User**: "My cat is scratching furniture"
**Context**: 3-year-old Maine Coon, has scratching post but prefers couch
**AI Response**:
```
üêï Behavior Analysis for Luna:

Maine Coons are natural scratchers, and Luna's behavior is normal but needs redirection. Here's how to address this:

Immediate Solutions:
‚Ä¢ Place scratching posts near the furniture she targets
‚Ä¢ Use double-sided tape on furniture temporarily
‚Ä¢ Provide multiple scratching surfaces (vertical and horizontal)

Long-term Training:
‚Ä¢ Reward her when she uses the scratching post
‚Ä¢ Use catnip to attract her to appropriate surfaces
‚Ä¢ Trim her nails regularly to reduce damage

Environmental Enrichment:
‚Ä¢ Add more vertical spaces (cat trees, shelves)
‚Ä¢ Provide interactive toys for mental stimulation
‚Ä¢ Consider a window perch for bird watching

Maine Coons are intelligent and respond well to positive reinforcement. Be patient and consistent with training.
```

### Emergency Query
**User**: "My dog ate chocolate"
**Context**: 5-year-old Labrador, ate dark chocolate bar
**AI Response**:
```
üö® Emergency Advice:

2. Call animal poison control: (888) 426-4435

4. Do NOT induce vomiting unless directed by a vet

SYMPTOMS TO WATCH:
‚Ä¢ Restlessness and hyperactivity
‚Ä¢ Increased heart rate
‚Ä¢ Muscle tremors
